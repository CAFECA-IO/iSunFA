    "EFFICIENT_DESCRIPTION": "By using a biological infection path model and a role division mechanism, we have designed a high-performance peer-to-peer network architecture. This architecture features fast communication and rapid protocol negotiation, enabling a blockchain platform that operates with efficiency comparable to traditional database systems, achieving high-speed computation and real-time consensus. Integrated with homomorphic encryption mechanisms, this blockchain network can securely process and store large amounts of financial data, support frequent access demands, and perform verification and computation without decrypting the data, effectively protecting privacy.",
    "DECENTRALIZED_TITLE": "Decentralized Identity Verification Mechanism",
    "DECENTRALIZED_DESCRIPTION": "Using elliptic curve digital signature technology based on a special process, user identities can be securely verified without transmitting private information to centralized systems. During identity verification, users must submit an identity declaration that includes validity time, applicable location, usage description, and supplementary information, and sign the declaration with their exclusive private key. This signature generates a time-sensitive and permission-limited identity credential, which can be verified by anyone through a public verification algorithm, without relying on centralized organizations or third-party services.",
    "ZK_PROOF_TITLE": "Homomorphic Encryption Blockchain Evidence Method",
    "ZK_PROOF_DESCRIPTION": "By transforming the raw data into matrix form and performing irreversible matrix operations to enhance its data dimensions, we then introduce random noise and apply multi-axis coordinate rotation. This process generates encrypted metadata with mathematical verifiability. While protecting data privacy, this metadata retains part of the original data's structure and characteristics, making it suitable for common mathematical and accounting operations such as summation, comparison, and trend analysis. This feature is highly suitable for accounting scenarios that balance data privacy, audit transparency, and compliance.",
    "REAL_TIME_TITLE": "Real-Time Accounting Report Generation Mechanism Based on Homomorphic Encryption Blockchain Evidence",
    "REAL_TIME_DESCRIPTION": "Building on the matrix transformation and multi-axis rotation encryption architecture, we further embed the difference value metadata of accounting reports into the noise addition process, creating a homomorphic encryption record system with privacy protection and verifiability. Each record, after encryption, retains its differential characteristics relative to accounting changes. By summing and cross-verifying all difference value metadata for a specified period, accounting reports can be generated in real-time without compromising privacy. This report, combined with the blockchain’s immutable evidence mechanism, ensures that each version is traceable, verifiable, and timely, ensuring data consistency and establishing a digital financial infrastructure that supports continuous auditing and real-time valuation.",
    "AUDIT_TITLE": "Audit Method Based on Homomorphic Encryption Blockchain Evidence",
    "AUDIT_DESCRIPTION": "The real-time accounting reports generated through the homomorphic encryption framework can be further integrated with blockchain and zero-knowledge proof technologies to achieve an audit process with privacy protection, high credibility, and efficiency. The process includes metadata integrity and consistency verification, identity and signature validation, as well as the derivation and verification of homomorphic encrypted data. Through this mechanism, auditing can be conducted without relying on third-party intermediaries and without exposing the original data, significantly improving audit efficiency, trust, and anti-counterfeiting capabilities, laying a solid foundation for continuous auditing and intelligent compliance."
