  "SUBSCRIPTION_FAQ": {
    "SUBSCRIPTION_FAQ": "Subscription FAQ",
    "FAQ1_QUESTION": "Can I use iSunFA for free?",
    "FAQ1_ANSWER": "Yes, iSunFA's beginner version is permanently free. Users can experience the platform's basic features without subscribing or binding a credit card, including uploading vouchers, AI recognition for automatic voucher conversion, and generating financial reports such as the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.",
    "FAQ2_QUESTION": "If I add team members, can we share the ledger?",
    "FAQ2_ANSWER": "In iSunFA’s Professional and Enterprise versions, users can add multiple team members to share the ledger and set different role permissions, such as Administrator or Viewer. The beginner version also allows creating one team but does not support sharing the ledger with other users.",
    "FAQ3_QUESTION": "What is financial report automation?",
    "FAQ3_ANSWER": "Financial report automation is a feature provided by iSunFA to help users automatically update the company’s three major financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Users can set the report generation cycle for the system to update the data periodically. However, this feature is only available to Professional and Enterprise users, while beginner users need to manually download reports.",
    "FAQ4_QUESTION": "What payment methods can I use?",
    "FAQ4_ANSWER": "Currently, iSunFA supports online payment methods, including credit cards (MasterCard, Visa, and JCB). Credit card payments allow automatic deductions to ensure subscription continuity.",
    "FAQ5_QUESTION": "How can I contact the sales team?",
    "FAQ5_ANSWER": "If you have further needs or require special plans, you can contact us via email. Our email contact is contact@isunfa.com.",
    "FAQ6_QUESTION": "How can I upgrade my plan mid-subscription?",
    "FAQ6_ANSWER": "You can upgrade your iSunFA plan at any time. The process is simple—log into your account and go to the 'Subscription Management' page to choose an upgrade or plan change. You can cancel your subscription at any time, but the current paid plan will remain effective until the next renewal date, and the payment made for this cycle is non-refundable."
